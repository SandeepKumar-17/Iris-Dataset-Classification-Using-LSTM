# Iris-Dataset-Classification-Using-LSTM

This project implements an LSTM-based model to classify species in the Iris dataset. Leveraging Keras in Python, the project explores the effectiveness of LSTM networks—traditionally used for sequential data—in static dataset classification. By analyzing accuracy metrics, the project provides insights into the potential of LSTMs for small, structured datasets like Iris.
